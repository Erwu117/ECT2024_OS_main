To Do:
    -Adjust sleep time as necessary
    -Send data to gui and through the API
    -adjust sea_level_pressure depending on location

Install: 
    pip install adafruit-circuitpython-bmp180
Initialize:
    nano bmp180.py

Import:
    time - sleep script in between readings
    bmp180 - import sensor
    board - reference raspberry pi

Code:
    i2c = board.I2C()
    bmp = bmp180.BMP180(i2c)

    # change this to match the location's pressure (hPa) at sea level
    bmp.sea_level_pressure = 1013.25 //Necessary to get accurate altitude readings

    while True:
        bmp_tempc = bmp.temperature
        bmp_pressure = bmp.pressure
        bmp_altitude = bmp.altitude


        //Change to send data where it is needed
        print(f"Temperature: {bmp.temperature:.1f} Â°C")
        print(f"Pressure: {bmp.pressure:.1f} hPa")
        print(f"Altitude: {bmp.altitude:.1f} mts")
        print("")


        time.sleep(2) //Adjust time as necessary
